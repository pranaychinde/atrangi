        <h2><strong>Dual-Axis Solar Tracker</strong></h2>
        <p>Nowadays the demand for energy is continuously growing which has led to find out the proportion of electrical energy using clean and renewable sources such as solar energy, wind energy,etc.
            Our environment provides us lot of things, Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.
            So, protecting the environment is significant because environmental degradation is irreversible or may be very harmful to all animals, humans, or plants. It is important to take care of the environment, so here we are with one project which gives us lot of applications. 
            So let us introduce with the project dual axis solar tracker. We are glad to share you that we are able to give our little bit contribution in order to protect the environment using our field knowledge.
            Solar energy is the energy which the earth receives from the sun which converts into thermal or electrical energy. Moreover, solar energy influences the climate of the earth and weather to sustain life. It has great potential which we must use to our advantage fully.
            As it is environment-friendly, it is very important in todays world. It is so much better than other pollution sources of energies like fossil fuels and more. Further, it has low maintenance costs.

        <h2><strong>Solar Energy</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Solar energy technologies and power plants do not produce air pollution or greenhouse gases when operating. Using solar energy can have a positive, indirect effect on the environment when solar energy replaces or reduces the 
            use of other energy sources that have larger effects on the environment.
            The increased energy production from solar trackers can reduce the reliance on backup power sources, 
            such as fossil fuel-based generators. This not only lowers carbon emissions but also decreases the environmental impact associated with extracting, transporting, and burning fossil fuels,
            solar trackers protect natural resources by optimizing land use, reducing material consumption, conserving water, mitigating environmental impact, and contributing to a more sustainable and efficient use of resources in the generation of clean, renewable energy.

            <h2><strong>How Circuit Works?</strong></h2>
            <p>Components Needed: Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno),
                Dual-axis Solar Tracker Mechanism,
                Two LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors),
                DC Motors (for horizontal and vertical movement),
                Power Supply,
                Solar Panels.
                <ul>
                    <li>LDRs are used as the main light sensors.
                         Two servo motors are fixed to the structure that holds the solar panel. The program for Arduino is uploaded to the microcontroller. LDRs sense the amount of sunlight falling on them. Four LDRs are divided into top, bottom, left and right.</li>
                    <li>For east – west tracking, the analog values from two top LDRs and two bottom LDRs are compared and if the top set of LDRs receive more light, the vertical servo will move in that direction.
                        If the bottom LDRs receive more light, the servo moves in that direction.</li>
                    <li>or angular deflection of the solar panel, the analog values from two left LDRs and two right LDRs are compared. If the left set of LDRs receive more light than the right set, the horizontal servo will move in that direction.
                        If the right set of LDRs receive more light, the servo moves in that direction.</li>
                 </ul>
            </p>

                <h2><strong>Advantages and Applications</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            By tracking the sun's movement, solar trackers ensure that solar panels receive maximum sunlight throughout the day. This optimized energy production allows for the generation of more electricity using fewer panels, reducing the need for raw materials in solar panel manufacturing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Solar trackers maximize the efficiency of solar panels, generating more energy per unit of land compared to fixed installations. This efficiency reduces the overall land footprint required for solar energy generation, helping to conserve natural habitats and ecosystems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Solar trackers are widely used in large-scale solar power plants to optimize energy production by ensuring that solar panels continuously face the sun. This maximizes electricity generation and improves the overall efficiency of the solar farm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Solar trackers can be integrated into solar-powered irrigation systems for agriculture. By tracking the sun's movement, the trackers optimize energy capture, allowing for efficient and sustainable irrigation in remote or off-grid agricultural areas.
                        </li>
